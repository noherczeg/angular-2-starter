# Angular 2 Starter
This is a starter project made as a practice. It's aim is to not use any
global NPM stuff and possibly give a nice clean start for projects.

### Installation
Run `npm install`.

### Sample for running commands locally
`$(npm bin)/typings install --global --save dt~core-js`

### NPM scripts
Live reload local: `npm run serve`

Simple build: `npm run build`

Production build: `npm run build:prod`
